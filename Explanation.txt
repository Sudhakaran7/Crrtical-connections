There are n servers numbered from 0 to n-1 connected by undirected server-to-server connections forming a network where connections[i] = [a, b] represents a connection 
between servers a and b. Any server can reach any other server directly or indirectly through the network.
A critical connection is a connection that, if removed, will make some server unable to reach some other server.
Return all critical connections in the network in any order

Input Description:
First line contains, N the number of connections.
rest lline contains, the Nx2 integers in matrix.

Output Description:
print all critical connections in the network in any order.

Sample Input:
4
0 1
1 2
2 0
1 3

Sample Output:
[1,3]

Explanation:
A critical connection is a connection that, if removed, will make some server unable to reach some other server. so by the definiton 1,3 if we remove
the connection between them will get cut that is the critical.
